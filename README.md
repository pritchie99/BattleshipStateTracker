Battleship State Tracker with tests

NB I have assumed that the purpose of the excercise is to produce clean, maintainable code and that the target audience will be more easily able to determine whether this was achieved without additional code artifacts being present.

My rule of thumb for commenting code is to maximise the ability for someone else to subsequently maintain the code in isolation.  In order to do that, comments that specify the intention of the code are most helpful in achieving this.
